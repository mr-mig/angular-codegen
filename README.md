Exploration of REST-based Code on Demand techniques with AngularJS

Just in case anyone is interested in bringing together this stack,
I've made an exploration project which uses the following tech:

* Scala
* Scalaz
* AngularJS
* RequireJS
* CoffeeScript
* Spray.io
* Akka (implied by Spray.io but also used separately)
* Scalate

The problem domain modeled is the
[Atom Feed Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287)
and is only mocked with regard to the feed itself.  While I consider
it an interesting research/exploration effort in seeing what can be
done with a [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) architecture,
YMMV :-).

In any event, it's BSD licensed and might be of benefit if you are
interested in bringing together these libraries.  Note that the intent
of this project is to see what can be done with AngularJS's ability to
define custom directives and how these directives are very similar to
XML.  However, efforts not involving such an interest may still benefit
from snippets/idioms used.

enjoy!
